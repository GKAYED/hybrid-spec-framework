# Template 2: Specification extraction & Multi-Model Validation

**Purpose**: Reverse-engineer your working implementation into comprehensive AI-readable specifications, then validate by having multiple AI models independently rebuild it.

---

## üìö Prerequisites

Before starting specification extraction, you should have:
- ‚úÖ A working implementation from Template 1 (Conversational Build)
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of what each feature does and why
- ‚úÖ Documentation showing how to run and test the application
- ‚úÖ Confidence that this implementation represents a valid solution

---

## üéØ Phase 1: Specification extraction prompt

**Instructions**: Use this prompt with an AI model to transform your working code into formal specifications. This works best with models that have seen your codebase.

### Specification extraction prompt template

```
I have a working [PROJECT TYPE] application that I want to formalize into comprehensive specifications following the GitHub Spec Kit framework.

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- Name: [Project Name]
- Purpose: [One-sentence description]
- Current State: [e.g., "Fully functional, 28 files, 2,400+ LOC, tested and deployed"]
- Technology Stack: [List main technologies]

**MY GOAL:**
Create 4 specification documents that would enable ANY AI model to independently reproduce this project with high fidelity, without seeing the original code or our conversation history.

**REQUIRED SPECIFICATION DOCUMENTS (GitHub Spec Kit Compatible):**

**Core Documents** (Required - stored in `.specify/memory/` or feature directories):

1. **constitution.md** (~9,000 characters)
   - Project vision and core values
   - Architectural principles and patterns (Articles I-IX)
   - Quality standards and non-negotiables
   - Technology philosophy and constraints
   - Constitutional "gates" for enforcement
   - What makes this project unique

2. **specification.md** (~25,000 characters)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Functional requirements (every feature described)
   - API contracts (all endpoints with request/response examples)
   - Database schema (tables, fields, relationships, constraints)
   - Data models and validation rules
   - UI/UX requirements and user flows

3. **plan.md** (~17,000 characters)
   - Technology stack decisions with justifications
   - System architecture and component interaction
   - File structure and organization
   - Deployment strategy
   - Testing approach
   - Development phases and milestones
   - Pre-implementation gates (Phase -1)

4. **tasks.md** (~24,000 characters)
   - Implementation broken into phases
   - Each phase has specific tasks
   - Each task has acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies between tasks are clear
   - Parallelization markers [P] for independent tasks
   - Estimated complexity/time per task

**Supporting Documents** (Optional but Recommended - auto-generated by Spec Kit):

5. **data-model.md** - Entity schemas, relationships, constraints
6. **contracts/** folder - API contracts (one file per endpoint)
7. **research.md** - Technology investigation and comparisons
8. **quickstart.md** - Key validation scenarios and acceptance tests
9. **implementation-details/** folder - Detailed algorithms, code samples

**NOTE**: Character counts are guidelines, not requirements. Project complexity determines actual document size.

**ELEMENTS OF EXCELLENT SPECIFICATIONS:**

‚úÖ **Completeness**: Every feature, endpoint, table, and behavior is documented
‚úÖ **Precision**: No ambiguity - "the system should..." is specific, not vague
‚úÖ **Examples**: Include sample inputs/outputs, API request/response pairs, data examples
‚úÖ **Constraints**: Document what NOT to do (e.g., "avoid external API dependencies")
‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**: Each requirement has testable success conditions
‚úÖ **Context**: Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT to build
‚úÖ **Self-Contained**: An AI with no prior context could understand and implement

**WHAT TO AVOID:**

‚ùå Vague requirements like "should be fast" (instead: "API responses <100ms")
‚ùå Missing edge cases (document error handling, empty states, validation)
‚ùå Assumed knowledge (explain acronyms, patterns, conventions)
‚ùå Implementation details without rationale (explain the "why" behind "what")
‚ùå Incomplete API contracts (every endpoint needs full request/response examples)

**MY CODEBASE:**

[Attach your project files or provide repository link]

**YOUR TASK:**

Analyze my implementation and create all 4 specification documents. Focus on:
1. Capturing the INTENT behind each feature, not just the code
2. Documenting implicit decisions that "just work" in the code
3. Making acceptance criteria measurable and testable
4. Ensuring another AI could rebuild this with 90%+ fidelity

Please start with constitution.md, then proceed through the other documents systematically.
```

## üîç Phase 2: Specification quality review

After receiving your specifications, validate them against these criteria:

### Quality checklist

#### Constitution.md
- [ ] Project vision is clear and inspiring
- [ ] Architectural principles are specific (not generic)
- [ ] Technology constraints are justified
- [ ] Quality standards are measurable
- [ ] Unique aspects of the project are highlighted

#### Specification.md
- [ ] Every user-facing feature has a user story
- [ ] All API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Database schema includes constraints and indexes
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are covered
- [ ] UI/UX flows are described in detail

#### Plan.md
- [ ] Technology choices are justified (not just listed)
- [ ] System architecture diagram or clear description exists
- [ ] File structure is complete and logical
- [ ] Deployment process is step-by-step
- [ ] Testing strategy is specific

#### Tasks.md
- [ ] Phases build on each other logically
- [ ] Each task is independently achievable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Dependencies are clear

### Refinement prompt (if needed)

```
I've reviewed the specifications. Here are areas that need more detail:

**Section: [e.g., specification.md - API Contracts]**
Issue: [e.g., "The /api/search endpoint needs request/response examples"]
What I need: [e.g., "Show example query parameters and the exact JSON response structure"]

**Section: [e.g., tasks.md - Phase 3]**
Issue: [e.g., "Task 3.2 is too vague"]
What I need: [e.g., "Break this into subtasks with specific acceptance criteria"]

Please enhance these sections with the level of detail needed for an AI to implement without guessing.
```

---

## ü§ñ Phase 3: Multi-model validation (the critical test)

Now test if your specifications actually work by having **multiple AI models** independently rebuild your project.

### Step 3.1: Prepare experiment context

Create a simple context document:

```markdown
# Rebuild experiment

**Your Task**: Implement the complete project described in these specifications.

**What You Have:**
- constitution.md (project principles and architecture)
- specification.md (features, API, database)
- plan.md (technology stack and strategy)
- tasks.md (implementation breakdown)

**What You DON'T Have:**
- Original codebase
- Conversation history
- Additional context beyond these specs

**Success Criteria:**
- All features from specification.md work correctly
- All API endpoints respond as documented
- Database schema matches exactly
- Application runs without errors
- Core user flows work end-to-end

**Your Deliverables:**
1. Complete working implementation
2. README with setup instructions
3. Brief summary of any ambiguities you encountered

Please implement this project based ONLY on the specifications provided.
```

### Step 3.2: Run parallel implementations

Test with 2-3 different AI models (recommended combinations):

**Option A: Cross-Vendor Validation**
- Model 1: Claude (Anthropic)
- Model 2: GPT-4/5 (OpenAI)
- Model 3: Gemini (Google)

**Option B: Same Vendor, Different Capabilities**
- Model 1: Claude Sonnet (balanced)
- Model 2: Claude Opus (high capability)
- Model 3: Claude Haiku (fast/efficient)

### Step 3.3: Implementation prompt (for each model)

```
I have comprehensive specifications for a [PROJECT TYPE] project. I want you to implement the complete application based ONLY on these specifications.

**Context Document:**
[Paste your experiment context from Step 3.1]

**Specifications:**
[Attach all 4 specification documents]

**Instructions:**
1. Read all specifications carefully
2. Implement the complete project
3. Follow the architecture and technology stack exactly as specified
4. If anything is ambiguous, document your assumption and proceed
5. Test your implementation to ensure it matches acceptance criteria

Please start by confirming you understand the requirements, then begin implementation.
```

---

## üìä Phase 4: Cross-model analysis

After all models complete their implementations, analyze the results:

### Analysis framework

Create a comparison document locally:

```markdown
# Multi-Model Specification Validation

## Implementation summary

| Model | Time | Files Created | Lines of Code | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| [Model 1] | [Time] | [Count] | [LOC] | [Working/Broken] |
| [Model 2] | [Time] | [Count] | [LOC] | [Working/Broken] |
| [Model 3] | [Time] | [Count] | [LOC] | [Working/Broken] |

## Feature completeness

| Feature | Original | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| [Feature 1] | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è |
| [Feature 2] | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è |
| [Feature 3] | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è |

## Specification adherence

**Model 1: [Name]**
- Spec Adherence: [%]
- What it got right: [List]
- What it missed: [List]
- Interpretation differences: [List]

**Model 2: [Name]**
- Spec Adherence: [%]
- What it got right: [List]
- What it missed: [List]
- Interpretation differences: [List]

**Model 3: [Name]**
- Spec Adherence: [%]
- What it got right: [List]
- What it missed: [List]
- Interpretation differences: [List]

## Specification quality insights

### What worked well
- [Aspect of specs that all models interpreted correctly]
- [Clear requirement that led to consistent implementations]

### Ambiguities discovered
- [Requirement that was interpreted differently]
- [Missing detail that caused models to guess]
- [Vague acceptance criteria that led to variation]

### Recommended spec improvements
1. **[Section/Requirement]**: [What to add/clarify]
2. **[Section/Requirement]**: [What to add/clarify]
3. **[Section/Requirement]**: [What to add/clarify]

## Success metrics

- **Cross-Model Agreement**: [%] (features implemented identically)
- **Average Spec Adherence**: [%]
- **Production-Ready Implementations**: [X] of [Y]
- **Time to Implementation**: [Average time]

## Key learnings

1. [Learning about specification quality]
2. [Learning about model selection]
3. [Learning about what matters in specs]
```

---

## üéØ Phase 5: Specification refinement (Iterative)

Based on your analysis, refine your specifications:

### Refinement prompt

```
I tested my specifications with [N] AI models. Here's what I learned:

**Ambiguities Found:**
[List requirements that were interpreted differently or caused confusion]

**Missing Details:**
[List aspects that models had to guess about]

**Over-Specified Areas:**
[List areas where specs were unnecessarily detailed]

Please revise the specifications to:
1. Clarify the ambiguous sections
2. Add the missing details with examples
3. Simplify over-specified areas
4. Ensure 90%+ cross-model implementation consistency

Focus on [specification.md / constitution.md / plan.md / tasks.md] based on the findings.
```

---

## üèÜ Success Criteria: When Are Your Specs "Good"?

Your specifications are production-ready when:

### Quantitative metrics
- ‚úÖ **2+ AI models** achieve 90%+ feature completeness
- ‚úÖ **Average spec adherence** across models is 85%+
- ‚úÖ **Core functionality** works identically across implementations
- ‚úÖ **Time to implementation** is consistent (¬±30% variance)

### Qualitative signals
- ‚úÖ Models ask **<5 clarification questions** during implementation
- ‚úÖ Implementations are **architecturally similar**
- ‚úÖ Edge cases are **handled consistently**
- ‚úÖ You can **swap implementations** without user-visible changes

### The ultimate test
- ‚úÖ An AI model **you've never used before** can build your project successfully
- ‚úÖ The implementation is **production-ready** without refinement
- ‚úÖ You'd be **comfortable deploying** any of the AI-built versions

## üéì Pro Tips for Specification Success

### 1. **Don't Skip the Conversational Build**
Attempting to write specs without a working implementation leads to theoretical documents that don't survive contact with reality.

### 2. **Test with Models You Haven't Used Yet**
If you wrote specs while talking to Claude, test with GPT and Gemini. Fresh eyes reveal ambiguities you missed.

### 3. **Disagreement is Data**
When two models build different things from the same spec, that's VALUABLE feedback about where your spec is vague.

### 4. **Document the "Why" Not Just the "What"**
Code shows what to build. Specs should explain why you made each decision. This helps AI understand intent.

### 5. **Examples Are Worth 1,000 Words**
One concrete API request/response example is clearer than three paragraphs describing the endpoint.

### 6. **Accept 90%, Not 100%**
Different AI models have different "personalities." Aiming for 100% consistency across all models is unrealistic. 90%+ on core features is excellent.

### 7. **Iterate Based on Real Failures**
Don't theoretically improve specs. Let models fail, analyze why, then fix those specific issues.

## üîó Relationship to GitHub Spec Kit

This Hybrid Specification Development Framework is **compatible with** but **independent from** [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit):

### GitHub Spec Kit approach
- Provides slash commands (`/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`)
- Uses interactive templates to guide AI during spec creation
- Enforces constitutional principles through pre-implementation gates
- Optimized for greenfield (0‚Üí1) development
- Works with supported AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

### This framework approach
- Uses conversational prototyping for exploration and learning
- Extracts specs from working implementations (reverse engineering)
- Validates specs through multi-model testing (empirical validation)
- Optimized for learning, experimentation, and cross-model validation
- Tool-agnostic (works with any AI model)

### How They Relate

**Same Goal**: Create executable specifications that drive development

**Different Paths**:
```
Spec Kit Path:
  Human ‚Üí Slash Commands ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Specs ‚Üí Implementation

This Framework Path:
  Human ‚Üí Conversational Build ‚Üí Spec Extraction ‚Üí Multi-Model Validation ‚Üí Refined Specs
```

**You Can**:
- ‚úÖ Use this framework to **learn** specification-driven development concepts
- ‚úÖ Transition to Spec Kit slash commands once comfortable with the structure
- ‚úÖ Combine approaches (prototype conversationally, formalize with Spec Kit)
- ‚úÖ Use Spec Kit for production, this framework for experimentation and validation
- ‚úÖ Generate Spec Kit-compatible artifacts through either path

**When to Use Which**:

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Learning spec-driven development | This Framework (hands-on experimentation) |
| Building new project from scratch | Spec Kit (faster with templates) |
| Reverse-engineering existing code | This Framework (extraction-focused) |
| Cross-vendor AI validation | This Framework (multi-model testing) |
| Production development | Spec Kit (integrated tooling) |
| Teaching others | This Framework (conceptual understanding) |
| Rapid iteration on features | Spec Kit (streamlined workflow) |

---

## üéì Best practices: Bridging Both Approaches

### 1. Start with This Framework for Learning

**Why**: Understanding how specifications work by building and extracting teaches you the underlying principles.

**Process**:
1. Build something small conversationally (Template 1)
2. Extract specs manually (Template 2)
3. Validate with 2-3 AI models
4. See What works and what doesn't

**Outcome**: Deep understanding of what makes specs "good" vs "bad"

### 2. Adopt Spec Kit Constitutional Principles Early

Even when using this framework, follow Spec Kit's constitutional articles:

**Article I - Library-First Principle**:
- Every feature begins as a standalone library
- Ensures modularity from the start

**Article III - Test-First Imperative**:
- Write tests before implementation
- Get tests approved before generating code
- Validate tests FAIL first (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)

**Article VII-VIII - Simplicity & Anti-Abstraction**:
- Start with ‚â§3 projects/modules
- Use framework features directly (don't wrap unnecessarily)
- Justify every layer of abstraction

**Article IX - Integration-First Testing**:
- Use real databases, not mocks
- Test in realistic environments
- Contract tests before implementation

**How to Apply in This Framework**:
When extracting specs (Template 2), explicitly ask the AI:
```
Include constitutional gates in the plan.md document:
- Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates
  - Simplicity Gate: Are we using ‚â§3 projects?
  - Anti-Abstraction Gate: Are we using frameworks directly?
  - Integration-First Gate: Are contracts defined with real environment tests?
```

### 3. Use Spec Kit Document Structure

Even when extracting manually, follow Spec Kit's organization:

**Directory Structure**:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .specify/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constitution.md          # Global principles
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                      # Helper scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/                    # Your custom templates
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-feature-name/             # Feature-specific specs
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specification.md          # What to build
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                   # How to build
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                  # Implementation breakdown
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-model.md             # Entities & relationships
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research.md               # Technology choices
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quickstart.md             # Validation scenarios
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/                # API contracts
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-endpoint-1.md
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-endpoint-2.md
```

**Benefit**: Your manually-created specs are compatible with Spec Kit tooling if you later adopt it.

### 4. Write Specs for Humans AND AI

**For Humans**:
- Clear rationale for decisions
- Examples and scenarios
- Visual diagrams where helpful
- "Why" explanations, not just "what"

**For AI**:
- Precise acceptance criteria
- Unambiguous requirements
- Explicit constraints and validations
- Machine-parseable formats (tables, checklists)

**Example of Good Dual-Purpose Spec**:
```markdown
### User Story: Search Functionality

**For Product Manager** (Human-Readable):
Users need to quickly find resources by keyword. This is critical because
our user research shows 73% of users know exactly what they're looking for
and get frustrated by browsing.

**Acceptance Criteria** (AI-Readable):
- [ ] Search box visible on main page
- [ ] Search executes on keypress (debounced 300ms)
- [ ] Results update in real-time (< 200ms)
- [ ] Minimum 2 characters required
- [ ] Display "No results found" when query returns 0 items
- [ ] Highlight matching terms in results
- [ ] Support partial word matching (e.g., "java" matches "javascript")

**API Contract** (AI-Executable):
GET /api/search?q={query}&limit={limit}
Response: { results: [{ id, title, url, snippet, match_score }] }
```

### 5. Validate Constitutional Compliance

After extracting specs, check them against Spec Kit principles:

**Checklist**:
```markdown
Constitution Validation:
- [ ] Every feature defined as independent library/module?
- [ ] CLI interface specified for all functionality?
- [ ] Test-first approach documented in tasks.md?
- [ ] Simplicity gates defined (‚â§3 projects)?
- [ ] Framework features used directly (no unnecessary wrappers)?
- [ ] Integration tests with real dependencies specified?
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable?
```

**If you find gaps**, refine your specs before multi-model validation.

### 6. Transition Path: Framework ‚Üí Spec Kit

Once you've mastered this framework, transitioning to Spec Kit is straightforward:

**Step 1**: Install Spec Kit CLI
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

**Step 2**: Initialize your project
```bash
specify init my-project --ai claude  # or copilot, cursor, etc.
```

**Step 3**: Use your learned knowledge
You now understand:
- ‚úÖ What makes a good constitution (you've written one)
- ‚úÖ How to write precise specifications (you've extracted them)
- ‚úÖ What AI models need to succeed (you've tested 2-3 models)
- ‚úÖ How to validate spec quality (you've measured adherence)

**Step 4**: Use slash commands with confidence
```
/speckit.constitution    # You know what principles matter
/speckit.specify         # You know what details to include
/speckit.plan            # You know what decisions need documentation
/speckit.tasks           # You know how to break down implementation
```

### 7. Combine Approaches for Maximum Power

**Hybrid Workflow** (Best of Both Worlds):

1. **Exploration Phase** (This Framework):
   - Build conversationally to explore problem space
   - Test multiple approaches quickly
   - Extract specs from working prototype

2. **Formalization Phase** (Spec Kit):
   - Use `/speckit.specify` to create formal feature specs
   - Leverage templates for consistency
   - Apply constitutional gates

3. **Validation Phase** (This Framework):
   - Give specs to 2-3 different AI models
   - Compare implementations
   - Identify ambiguities

4. **Refinement Phase** (Spec Kit):
   - Update specs based on validation findings
   - Use `/speckit.plan` to regenerate implementation plans
   - Execute with `/speckit.implement`

**This gives you**:
- Speed of conversational exploration
- Rigor of template-driven formalization
- Confidence of multi-model validation
- Efficiency of integrated tooling

### 8. Document Your Journey

Whether using this framework or Spec Kit, maintain learning logs:

**What to Track**:
- Which specs led to successful implementations?
- What ambiguities caused models to diverge?
- Which constitutional gates caught problems?
- What patterns emerged across projects?

**Where to Document**:
```
your-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .specify/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ learnings/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ successful-patterns.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common-pitfalls.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model-behaviors.md
```

**Why It Matters**: Your organization's collective knowledge about what makes specs effective becomes a competitive advantage.
