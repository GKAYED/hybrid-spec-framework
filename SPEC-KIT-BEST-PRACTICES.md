## When to transition to Spec Kit

**You're ready for Spec Kit when:**

- ‚úÖ You've completed at least 2-3 projects using this framework's templates
- ‚úÖ You understand the value of specifications through hands-on experience
- ‚úÖ Your specs consistently achieve 85%+ adherence across multiple AI models
- ‚úÖ You're starting projects more frequently and need efficiency
- ‚úÖ Your team wants standardized workflows and templates
- ‚úÖ You need version control integration and CI/CD automation

**You should keep using this framework when:**

- üéì You're still learning specification-driven development principles
- üß™ You're experimenting with different spec structures
- üìä You want to validate specs across multiple AI models
- üîç You're reverse-engineering existing projects to extract specs
- üìñ You're teaching others about specification principles

---

## Understanding Spec Kit's philosophy

### Core principles

Spec Kit is built around three fundamental concepts:

#### 1. **Intent-driven development**
```
Your specifications should capture WHAT you want, not HOW to build it.
Let the AI handle the implementation details.
```

**Framework Connection:** Our Template 2 teaches you to separate intent from implementation through the conversational ‚Üí spec extraction process.

#### 2. **Executable specifications**
```
Specs aren't static documents‚Äîthey're living instructions that:
- Drive multi-step development workflows
- Enable AI agents to build iteratively
- Provide feedback loops for refinement
```

**Framework Connection:** Our multi-model validation teaches you to measure if specs are truly "executable" by testing with different AI models.

#### 3. **Multi-phase refinement**
```
Spec Kit supports three development phases:
- Greenfield: 0-to-1 new projects
- Creative Exploration: Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Brownfield: Refactoring and improving existing codebases
```

**Framework Connection:** This framework focuses on Greenfield and Creative Exploration phases‚Äîlearning by building from scratch.

## Getting started with Spec Kit CLI

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Python 3.11+
- Git

```bash
# Install Spec Kit globally (recommended)
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Or use without installing (one-time usage)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>

# Verify installation
specify check
```

**To upgrade Spec Kit:**
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

### Your first Spec Kit project

**Step 1: Initialize a new project**
```bash
# Create and initialize a new project
specify init my-new-project

# Or initialize with specific AI agent
specify init my-new-project --ai copilot

# Or initialize in current directory
specify init . --ai copilot
# Or use --here flag
specify init --here --ai copilot
```

**Supported AI agents:**
- `claude` - Claude Code
- `copilot` - GitHub Copilot
- `gemini` - Gemini CLI
- `cursor-agent` - Cursor
- `windsurf` - Windsurf
- `qwen` - Qwen Code
- And more (see [official docs](https://github.com/github/spec-kit))

**Supported AI agents:**
- `claude` - Claude Code
- `copilot` - GitHub Copilot
- `gemini` - Gemini CLI
- `cursor-agent` - Cursor
- `windsurf` - Windsurf
- `qwen` - Qwen Code
- And more (see [official docs](https://github.com/github/spec-kit))

**Step 3: Create your constitution**

Use the `/speckit.constitution` command in your AI agent to establish project principles:

```
You: /speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, 
testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

The AI will help you create a `constitution.md` file with your project's rules. Consider these questions:

```markdown
# constitution.md

## Project identity
- What is this project's single most important goal?
- What makes this project unique?

## Technical principles
- What technologies MUST be used? (e.g., "Always use SQLite for data storage")
- What patterns MUST be followed? (e.g., "All components must be tested")
- What should be AVOIDED? (e.g., "No premature abstraction")

## Quality standards
- What defines "done" for a feature?
- What level of documentation is required?
- How should errors be handled?
```

**Framework Connection:** Use your Template 2 constitutional articles as a starting point! Copy the principles that worked well.

**Step 4: Define your specification**

Use the `/speckit.specify` command to describe what you want to build:

```
You: /speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize 
my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can 
be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page.
```

Focus on the WHAT and WHY, not the tech stack yet:Focus on the WHAT and WHY, not the tech stack yet:

```markdown
## Core features
1. Photo album management - Users can create, rename, delete albums
2. Date-based organization - Albums automatically group by date
3. Drag-and-drop interface - Intuitive reorganization
4. Photo preview - Tile-based display within albums

## User interactions
- Main page shows all albums with date labels
- Drag album cards to reorder them
- Click album to see photos in tile view
- No nested albums (flat structure)
```

**Step 5: Create implementation plan**

Use `/speckit.plan` to define your tech stack and architecture:

```
You: /speckit.plan Use Vite with minimal libraries. Vanilla HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript. Images stored locally, metadata in SQLite database.
```

**Step 6: Break down into tasks**

Use `/speckit.tasks` to generate an actionable task list:

```
You: /speckit.tasks
```

**Step 7: Execute implementation**

Use `/speckit.implement` to build your feature according to the plan:

```
You: /speckit.implement
```

The AI agent will work through all tasks systematically, building your application according to your constitution and specification.

- Security: [Authentication, data protection]
- Scalability: [Growth expectations]
```

## Best practices for using Spec Kit

### 1. **Start with a strong constitution**

Your constitution is the "operating system" for your project. Invest time upfront to define:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Write specific, testable principles ("All functions must have JSDoc comments")
- Include examples of good vs bad code
- Reference specific libraries/frameworks by name
- Update the constitution when you discover new patterns

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Write vague principles ("Code should be clean")
- Copy generic best practices that don't fit your project
- Lock yourself into decisions too early‚Äîconstitutions can evolve
- Forget to document WHY a principle exists

**Example from our AI Agent experiment:**

```markdown
## Article I: Library-first development
When a task can be solved with a well-maintained library, we MUST use the library.

Why: Our AI agent project validated this‚Äîimplementations using libraries 
(rss-parser, cheerio) achieved 95% spec adherence vs 40% for custom parsers.

Approved Libraries:
- RSS parsing: rss-parser
- Web scraping: cheerio
- Database: better-sqlite3
```

### 2. **Make specifications measurable**

Every requirement should have clear success criteria:

‚úÖ **Good Specification:**
```markdown
## RSS feed processing
The system shall fetch RSS feeds and extract articles with the following success criteria:
- Fetch at least 10 feeds in under 30 seconds
- Extract title, URL, date, and description from 95%+ of articles
- Handle feed errors gracefully (log and continue processing)
- Store deduplicated articles in SQLite database
```

‚ùå **Poor Specification:**
```markdown
## RSS feed processing
The system should be able to get RSS feeds and save them.
```

**Framework Connection:** Use the validation checklist from Template 2 to ensure specs are measurable before importing to Spec Kit.

### 3. **Use the plan as your thinking tool**

`plan.md` is where you break down HOW to implement your specification:

```markdown
# plan.md

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Goal:** Set up database and configuration system

Tasks:
1. Create SQLite schema for articles table
2. Implement config.js with environment variables
3. Write database initialization script

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database file created on first run
- Config loads from .env file
- Unit tests pass

## Phase 2: RSS Processing (Week 2)
...
```

**Pro Tip:** Use your Template 1 initial build as the prototype for Phase 1. You've already validated it works!

### 4. **Keep tasks atomic**

Each task in `tasks.md` should be completable in 1-4 hours:

‚úÖ **Good Task:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement RSS feed fetcher using rss-parser library
  - Input: Array of feed URLs from config
  - Output: Array of parsed articles
  - Error handling: Log failed feeds, continue processing
  - Test: Mock HTTP responses with sample RSS XML
```

‚ùå **Poor Task:**
```markdown
- [ ] Build the RSS system
```

### 5. **Version control your specs**

Your `.specify/` directory should be committed to git alongside your code:

```bash
git add .specify/
git commit -m "Update specification: Add web scraping feature"
```

**Why:** Specs evolve as you learn. Version control lets you:
- See how requirements changed over time
- Rollback to previous specs if needed
- Collaborate on specification changes via pull requests
- Track correlation between spec changes and code quality

### 6. **Use slash commands strategically**

Spec Kit supports slash commands during AI chat sessions. Master these:

| Command | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/constitution` | Remind AI of core principles mid-conversation | "/constitution - Should we add error logging?" |
| `/specification` | Clarify if a feature request aligns with specs | "/specification - Is pagination mentioned?" |
| `/plan` | Check if current task fits the roadmap | "/plan - What phase are we in?" |
| `/tasks` | Review next actionable items | "/tasks - What's the priority?" |
| `/update [file]` | Modify a specification file | "/update specification.md - Add pagination" |

**Pro Tip:** Use `/constitution` frequently! It's easy for AI conversations to drift from your core principles.

---

## Slash commands mastery

### Command reference

Spec Kit provides slash commands through your AI agent interface. All commands use the `/speckit.` prefix.

#### Core commands (essential workflow)

##### `/speckit.constitution`
**Purpose:** Create or update project governing principles and development guidelines.

**When to use:**
- At project start to establish rules
- When AI suggests solutions that might violate principles
- During code review to verify adherence

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "I want to add caching to improve performance"
AI: [Suggests in-memory caching with Redis]
You: "/speckit.constitution"
AI: [Displays Article I: Library-First, Article VIII: Use SQLite for all persistence]
You: "Based on our constitution, should we use SQLite for caching instead?"
AI: "Yes! Here's how to implement a cache table in SQLite..."
```

##### `/speckit.specify`
**Purpose:** Define what you want to build (requirements and user stories).

**When to use:**
- Describing new features or projects
- Clarifying feature boundaries
- Checking if a requirement already exists
- Validating that new ideas align with existing specs

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "Can we add email notifications when new articles arrive?"
You: "/speckit.specify"
AI: [Shows specification doesn't mention notifications]
You: "This would be a new feature. Should we update the spec first?"
AI: "Recommended. Here's a draft specification section..."
```

##### `/speckit.plan`
**Purpose:** Create technical implementation plans with your chosen tech stack.

**When to use:**
- After defining specifications
- Defining architecture and tech choices
- Prioritizing what to build next
- Checking if you're ahead/behind schedule

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.plan - What should I work on next?"
AI: "You're in Phase 2: RSS Processing. Next priority task is implementing
     the deduplication algorithm (Task 2.3 in tasks.md)"
```

##### `/speckit.tasks`
**Purpose:** Generate actionable task lists for implementation.

**When to use:**
- After creating implementation plan
- Starting a coding session
- Breaking down complex features
- Tracking progress

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.tasks - Show incomplete tasks"
AI: [Lists 5 open tasks]
You: "I completed task 2.3. Mark it done and show me task 2.4 details"
AI: [Updates tasks.md and provides detailed context for next task]
```

##### `/speckit.implement`
**Purpose:** Execute all tasks to build the feature according to the plan.

**When to use:**
- After tasks are defined and ready
- To build features systematically
- When you want AI to work through the full implementation

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.implement"
AI: [Begins working through tasks in tasks.md, implementing each according
     to constitution, specification, and plan]
```

#### Optional commands (enhanced quality)

##### `/speckit.clarify`
**Purpose:** Clarify underspecified areas before planning.

**When to use:**
- After writing initial specification
- Before creating implementation plan
- When you want AI to identify gaps

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.clarify"
AI: "I found 3 underspecified areas:
     1. Error handling strategy not defined
     2. Data validation rules unclear
     3. Performance requirements missing"
```

##### `/speckit.analyze`
**Purpose:** Cross-artifact consistency & coverage analysis.

**When to use:**
- After creating tasks, before implementing
- To validate alignment between constitution, spec, plan, and tasks
- Quality check before major development

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.analyze"
AI: "Analysis complete:
     ‚úÖ All tasks map to specification requirements
     ‚ö†Ô∏è  2 constitutional principles not addressed in plan
     ‚úÖ No orphaned tasks"
```

##### `/speckit.checklist`
**Purpose:** Generate custom quality checklists (like "unit tests for English").

**When to use:**
- Validating requirements completeness
- Checking specification clarity
- Ensuring consistency across artifacts

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/speckit.checklist"
AI: "Generated quality checklist:
     Requirements completeness: 18/20 criteria met
     Specification clarity: All requirements testable
     Constitutional alignment: 100%"
```### Advanced slash command patterns

#### Pattern 1: The constitution check
Before implementing any significant feature:
```
1. You: "/speckit.constitution"
2. [Review principles]
3. You: "/speckit.specify - Does this feature align?"
4. [If yes] You: "/speckit.plan - Where does it fit?"
5. [If yes] You: "/speckit.tasks - Create task for this"
6. You: "/speckit.implement"
```

#### Pattern 2: The spec drift detector
When AI suggests something that feels "off":
```
1. AI: "Let's add a MongoDB database for better scalability"
2. You: "/speckit.constitution"
3. AI: [Shows Article I: Always use SQLite]
4. You: "This violates our constitution. Propose an SQLite solution."
```

#### Pattern 3: The quality validation flow
Before major implementation:
```
1. You: "/speckit.specify" [Write initial requirements]
2. You: "/speckit.clarify" [Identify gaps]
3. [Address gaps in specification]
4. You: "/speckit.plan" [Create technical plan]
5. You: "/speckit.tasks" [Generate task list]
6. You: "/speckit.analyze" [Validate consistency]
7. You: "/speckit.checklist" [Quality check]
8. You: "/speckit.implement" [Execute]
```

### Slash commands cheatsheet
```
# Core workflow commands
/speckit.constitution    # Create/display core principles
/speckit.specify         # Define what to build

## Template customization

### Creating organization-wide templates

If you're on a team, create shared templates in your organization:

**Step 1: Create a template directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.specify/templates/my-org-template
cd ~/.specify/templates/my-org-template
```

**Step 2: Define your template structure**
```
my-org-template/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constitution.md          # Your org's standard principles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specification.md         # Template with sections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                  # Standard phase structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                 # Task template with categories
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .specify-template.json   # Metadata
```

**Step 3: Write `.specify-template.json`**
```json
{
  "name": "My Org Web App Template",
  "description": "Standard template for internal web applications",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Engineering Team",
  "tags": ["web", "internal", "node.js"]
}
```

**Step 4: Use the template**
```bash
specify init --template my-org-template
```

### Template best practices

**1. Include Placeholder Sections**
```markdown
# specification.md (Template)

## Overview
[FILL IN: 2-3 sentence project description]

## Core features
[FILL IN: List 3-5 primary features]

## Data model
[FILL IN: Define entities and relationships]
```

**2. Provide Examples in Comments**
```markdown
# constitution.md (Template)

## Article I: [Your Principle Name]
[Describe the principle]

<!-- Example:
## Article I: Library-first development
When solving a common problem, prefer well-maintained libraries over custom code.

Approved libraries:
- HTTP requests: axios
- Testing: jest
- Date handling: date-fns
-->
```

**3. Version Your Templates**
Track template changes so teams can adopt updates:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0 -m "Initial web app template"
git push --tags
```

---

## Combining framework + Spec Kit

### The hybrid workflow

Use both tools in sequence for maximum learning and efficiency:

#### Phase 1: Learning (use this framework)
**Tools:** Template 1 + Template 2  
**Duration:** 2-4 projects  
**Goal:** Build intuition for what makes good specifications

```
1. Pick a small project (e.g., todo app, RSS reader)
2. Use Template 1 to build conversationally with an AI
3. Use Template 2 to extract specifications from the conversation
4. Validate specs with 2-3 AI models
5. Measure adherence (aim for 85%+)
6. Reflect: What made the spec effective or ineffective?
```

**You'll learn:**
- How much detail specs need
- Which principles actually matter
- How different AI models interpret instructions
- What causes specification failures

#### Phase 2: Transition (hybrid approach)
**Tools:** This Framework + Spec Kit  
**Duration:** 2-3 projects  
**Goal:** Apply learnings to Spec Kit workflows

```
1. Use Template 2 to draft initial specifications
2. Validate with multi-model testing (framework approach)
3. Import refined specs into Spec Kit
4. Use Spec Kit's slash commands for development
5. Continue multi-model validation on final code
```

**You'll learn:**
- How to translate framework specs to Spec Kit format
- Which Spec Kit features provide most value
- How to customize constitutions effectively

#### Phase 3: Production (use Spec Kit)
**Tools:** Spec Kit CLI + Templates
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Goal:** Efficient, standardized specification-driven development

```
1. specify init --template [your-org-template]
2. Customize constitution based on project needs
3. Write specifications (now you know what works!)
4. Use slash commands through your AI agent for development
5. Periodically validate with multiple models (framework approach)
```**You'll benefit from:**
- Fast project initialization
- Standardized team workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Version-controlled specifications

### When to return to the framework

Even after adopting Spec Kit, use this framework for:

- **Experimentation:** Testing new constitutional principles before standardizing
- **Quality Audits:** Multi-model validation of critical specifications
- **Training:** Teaching new team members specification principles
- **Post-Mortems:** Analyzing why a project didn't meet expectations

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

### 1. **Over-specification in constitution**

‚ùå **Problem:**
```markdown
## Article I: Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons at end of statements
- Use camelCase for variables
[...50 more style rules]
```

‚úÖ **Solution:**
```markdown
## Article I: Code Style
Follow the project's .eslintrc and .prettierconfig for style.

Key principle: Consistency over personal preference.
```

**Why:** Constitutions should focus on *architectural* principles, not linting rules. Let automated tools handle style.

### 2. **Vague specifications**

‚ùå **Problem:**
```markdown
## Feature: User Management
The app should have user accounts and authentication.
```

‚úÖ **Solution:**
```markdown
## Feature: User Management

**Authentication:**
- Users register with email + password
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (min 12 rounds)
- JWT tokens for session management (24hr expiry)
- Forgot password flow via email

**Authorization:**
- Role-based: admin, editor, viewer
- Admins can CRUD all resources
- Editors can CRUD own resources
- Viewers read-only access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New user can register in <2 seconds
- Login failure shows generic error (security)
- Password reset email arrives in <5 minutes
```

### 3. **Not using slash commands**

‚ùå **Problem:** Long AI conversation drifts from original specifications.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Use `/constitution` every 5-10 messages to re-ground the AI.

### 4. **Forgetting to update specs**

‚ùå **Problem:** Your code evolves but specifications stay frozen.

‚úÖ **Solution:** 
```bash
# After completing a feature
specify chat "/update specification.md - Document feature X as implemented"
git add .specify/
git commit -m "docs: Update specs for feature X"
```

### 5. **Skipping the plan**

‚ùå **Problem:** Jumping straight from specification to code.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Always populate `plan.md` with phases, milestones, and acceptance criteria. It's your roadmap.

---

## Success metrics

### How to measure Spec Kit effectiveness

Track these metrics to know if you're using Spec Kit well:

#### 1. **Specification stability**
```
Spec Changes Per Week = (# of specification.md commits) / (weeks since project start)

Target: <2 changes per week after initial setup
```

**What it means:** Frequent spec changes suggest you're discovering requirements late. Good specs stabilize after initial drafting.

#### 2. **AI adherence rate**
```
Adherence Rate = (Features implemented correctly) / (Total features) √ó 100%

Target: 85%+ across multiple AI models
```

**How to measure:** Use this framework's multi-model validation on Spec Kit projects!

#### 3. **Task completion velocity**
```
Velocity = (Tasks completed this week) / (Tasks completed last week)

Target: Consistent velocity (1.0) or improving (>1.0)
```

**What it means:** If velocity drops, your tasks might be too large or specs too vague.

#### 4. **Constitutional violations**
```
Violations = (# of code reviews requesting changes for principle violations)

Target: <1 violation per 10 pull requests
```

**How to track:** Tag PR comments that cite Constitutional violations.

#### 5. **Time to first working feature**
```
Time to First Feature = (Hours from 'specify init' to first deployable feature)

Target: <8 hours for simple projects, <40 hours for complex
```

**Benchmark:** Compare against your Template 1 projects. Spec Kit should be faster after the learning curve.
