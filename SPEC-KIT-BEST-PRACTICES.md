## When to transition to Spec Kit

**You're ready for Spec Kit when:**

- ‚úÖ You've completed at least 2-3 projects using this framework's templates
- ‚úÖ You understand the value of specifications through hands-on experience
- ‚úÖ Your specs consistently achieve 85%+ adherence across multiple AI models
- ‚úÖ You're starting projects more frequently and need efficiency
- ‚úÖ Your team wants standardized workflows and templates
- ‚úÖ You need version control integration and CI/CD automation

**You should keep using this framework when:**

- üéì You're still learning specification-driven development principles
- üß™ You're experimenting with different spec structures
- üìä You want to validate specs across multiple AI models
- üîç You're reverse-engineering existing projects to extract specs
- üìñ You're teaching others about specification principles

---

## Understanding Spec Kit's philosophy

### Core principles

Spec Kit is built around three fundamental concepts:

#### 1. **Intent-Driven Development**
```
Your specifications should capture WHAT you want, not HOW to build it.
Let the AI handle the implementation details.
```

**Framework Connection:** Our Template 2 teaches you to separate intent from implementation through the conversational ‚Üí spec extraction process.

#### 2. **Executable Specifications**
```
Specs aren't static documents‚Äîthey're living instructions that:
- Drive multi-step development workflows
- Enable AI agents to build iteratively
- Provide feedback loops for refinement
```

**Framework Connection:** Our multi-model validation teaches you to measure if specs are truly "executable" by testing with different AI models.

#### 3. **Multi-Phase Refinement**
```
Spec Kit supports three development phases:
- Greenfield: 0-to-1 new projects
- Creative Exploration: Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Brownfield: Refactoring and improving existing codebases
```

**Framework Connection:** This framework focuses on Greenfield and Creative Exploration phases‚Äîlearning by building from scratch.

## Getting started with Spec Kit CLI

### Installation

```bash
# Install Spec Kit globally
npm install -g @github/specify-cli

# Or use with npx (no installation)
npx @github/specify-cli init
```

### Your first Spec Kit project

**Step 1: Initialize a new project**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-new-project

# Initialize Spec Kit
specify init
```

This creates:
- `.specify/` directory with configuration
- `constitution.md` (core principles)
- `specification.md` (technical requirements)
- `plan.md` (implementation strategy)
- `tasks.md` (actionable todos)

**Step 2: Customize your constitution**

The constitution defines YOUR project's rules. Start with these questions:

```markdown
# constitution.md

## Project identity
- What is this project's single most important goal?
- What makes this project unique?

## Technical principles
- What technologies MUST be used? (e.g., "Always use SQLite for data storage")
- What patterns MUST be followed? (e.g., "All components must be tested")
- What should be AVOIDED? (e.g., "No premature abstraction")

## Quality standards
- What defines "done" for a feature?
- What level of documentation is required?
- How should errors be handled?
```

**Framework Connection:** Use your Template 2 constitutional articles as a starting point! Copy the principles that worked well.

**Step 3: Write your specification**

```markdown
# specification.md

## Overview
[Brief description of what you're building]

## Core features
1. Feature A - [What it does, not how to build it]
2. Feature B - [Focus on user outcomes]
3. Feature C - [Describe the value, not the code]

## Data model
[Define your entities and relationships]

## User interactions
[Describe workflows from user perspective]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [Expected response times]
- Security: [Authentication, data protection]
- Scalability: [Growth expectations]
```

**Step 4: Use Spec Kit's AI agent integration**

```bash
# Start an AI-powered development session
specify chat

# The AI will read your constitution, specification, plan, and tasks
# and help you build according to your rules
```

---

## Best practices for using Spec Kit

### 1. **Start with a Strong Constitution**

Your constitution is the "operating system" for your project. Invest time upfront to define:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Write specific, testable principles ("All functions must have JSDoc comments")
- Include examples of good vs bad code
- Reference specific libraries/frameworks by name
- Update the constitution when you discover new patterns

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Write vague principles ("Code should be clean")
- Copy generic best practices that don't fit your project
- Lock yourself into decisions too early‚Äîconstitutions can evolve
- Forget to document WHY a principle exists

**Example from our AI Agent experiment:**

```markdown
## Article I: Library-first development
When a task can be solved with a well-maintained library, we MUST use the library.

Why: Our AI agent project validated this‚Äîimplementations using libraries 
(rss-parser, cheerio) achieved 95% spec adherence vs 40% for custom parsers.

Approved Libraries:
- RSS parsing: rss-parser
- Web scraping: cheerio
- Database: better-sqlite3
```

### 2. **Make Specifications Measurable**

Every requirement should have clear success criteria:

‚úÖ **Good Specification:**
```markdown
## RSS feed processing
The system shall fetch RSS feeds and extract articles with the following success criteria:
- Fetch at least 10 feeds in under 30 seconds
- Extract title, URL, date, and description from 95%+ of articles
- Handle feed errors gracefully (log and continue processing)
- Store deduplicated articles in SQLite database
```

‚ùå **Poor Specification:**
```markdown
## RSS feed processing
The system should be able to get RSS feeds and save them.
```

**Framework Connection:** Use the validation checklist from Template 2 to ensure specs are measurable before importing to Spec Kit.

### 3. **Use the Plan as Your Thinking Tool**

`plan.md` is where you break down HOW to implement your specification:

```markdown
# plan.md

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Goal:** Set up database and configuration system

Tasks:
1. Create SQLite schema for articles table
2. Implement config.js with environment variables
3. Write database initialization script

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database file created on first run
- Config loads from .env file
- Unit tests pass

## Phase 2: RSS Processing (Week 2)
...
```

**Pro Tip:** Use your Template 1 initial build as the prototype for Phase 1. You've already validated it works!

### 4. **Keep Tasks Atomic**

Each task in `tasks.md` should be completable in 1-4 hours:

‚úÖ **Good Task:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement RSS feed fetcher using rss-parser library
  - Input: Array of feed URLs from config
  - Output: Array of parsed articles
  - Error handling: Log failed feeds, continue processing
  - Test: Mock HTTP responses with sample RSS XML
```

‚ùå **Poor Task:**
```markdown
- [ ] Build the RSS system
```

### 5. **Version Control Your Specs**

Your `.specify/` directory should be committed to git alongside your code:

```bash
git add .specify/
git commit -m "Update specification: Add web scraping feature"
```

**Why:** Specs evolve as you learn. Version control lets you:
- See how requirements changed over time
- Rollback to previous specs if needed
- Collaborate on specification changes via pull requests
- Track correlation between spec changes and code quality

### 6. **Use Slash Commands Strategically**

Spec Kit supports slash commands during AI chat sessions. Master these:

| Command | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/constitution` | Remind AI of core principles mid-conversation | "/constitution - Should we add error logging?" |
| `/specification` | Clarify if a feature request aligns with specs | "/specification - Is pagination mentioned?" |
| `/plan` | Check if current task fits the roadmap | "/plan - What phase are we in?" |
| `/tasks` | Review next actionable items | "/tasks - What's the priority?" |
| `/update [file]` | Modify a specification file | "/update specification.md - Add pagination" |

**Pro Tip:** Use `/constitution` frequently! It's easy for AI conversations to drift from your core principles.

---

## Slash commands mastery

### Command reference

#### `/constitution`
**Purpose:** Display your project's core principles and rules.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new feature to ground the conversation
- When AI suggests a solution that might violate principles
- During code review to verify adherence

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "I want to add caching to improve performance"
AI: [Suggests in-memory caching with Redis]
You: "/constitution"
AI: [Displays Article I: Library-First, Article VIII: Use SQLite for all persistence]
You: "Based on our constitution, should we use SQLite for caching instead?"
AI: "Yes! Here's how to implement a cache table in SQLite..."
```

#### `/specification`
**Purpose:** Reference the full technical specification.

**When to use:**
- Clarifying feature boundaries
- Checking if a requirement already exists
- Validating that new ideas align with existing specs

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "Can we add email notifications when new articles arrive?"
You: "/specification"
AI: [Shows specification doesn't mention notifications]
You: "This would be a new feature. Should we update the spec first?"
AI: "Recommended. Here's a draft specification section..."
```

#### `/plan`
**Purpose:** Review the implementation roadmap.

**When to use:**
- Prioritizing what to build next
- Checking if you're ahead/behind schedule
- Deciding if a new task fits current phase

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/plan - What should I work on next?"
AI: "You're in Phase 2: RSS Processing. Next priority task is implementing 
     the deduplication algorithm (Task 2.3 in tasks.md)"
```

#### `/tasks`
**Purpose:** List actionable todo items.

**When to use:**
- Starting a coding session
- Marking tasks complete
- Breaking down a complex task

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "/tasks - Show incomplete tasks"
AI: [Lists 5 open tasks]
You: "I completed task 2.3. Mark it done and show me task 2.4 details"
AI: [Updates tasks.md and provides detailed context for next task]
```

#### `/update [file]`
**Purpose:** Modify specification files during development.

**When to use:**
- You discover new requirements
- A principle should be added/modified
- The plan needs adjustment based on learnings

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "We need to add a rate limiting principle to avoid hammering RSS servers"
You: "/update constitution.md"
AI: "I'll add Article X: Rate Limiting. Here's a draft:

## Article X: Respectful rate limiting
- Wait 1 second between feed fetches
- Implement exponential backoff for errors
- Cache results for 15 minutes minimum

Shall I commit this to constitution.md?"
```

### Advanced slash command patterns

#### Pattern 1: The Constitution Check
Before implementing any significant feature:
```
1. You: "/constitution"
2. [Review principles]
3. You: "/specification - Does this feature align?"
4. [If yes] You: "/plan - Where does it fit?"
5. [If yes] You: "/tasks - Create task for this"
```

#### Pattern 2: The Spec Drift Detector
When AI suggests something that feels "off":
```
1. AI: "Let's add a MongoDB database for better scalability"
2. You: "/constitution"
3. AI: [Shows Article I: Always use SQLite]
4. You: "This violates our constitution. Propose an SQLite solution."
```

#### Pattern 3: The Living Documentation Flow
As you learn during development:
```
1. You: [Discover that feed parsing needs custom error handling]
2. You: "/update specification.md - Add error handling requirements"
3. AI: [Drafts new section]
4. You: "/update plan.md - Add error handling task to Phase 2"
5. You: "/tasks - Create task: Implement RSS error handling"
```

## Template customization

### Creating organization-wide templates

If you're on a team, create shared templates in your organization:

**Step 1: Create a template directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.specify/templates/my-org-template
cd ~/.specify/templates/my-org-template
```

**Step 2: Define your template structure**
```
my-org-template/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constitution.md          # Your org's standard principles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specification.md         # Template with sections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                  # Standard phase structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                 # Task template with categories
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .specify-template.json   # Metadata
```

**Step 3: Write `.specify-template.json`**
```json
{
  "name": "My Org Web App Template",
  "description": "Standard template for internal web applications",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Engineering Team",
  "tags": ["web", "internal", "node.js"]
}
```

**Step 4: Use the template**
```bash
specify init --template my-org-template
```

### Template best practices

**1. Include Placeholder Sections**
```markdown
# specification.md (Template)

## Overview
[FILL IN: 2-3 sentence project description]

## Core features
[FILL IN: List 3-5 primary features]

## Data model
[FILL IN: Define entities and relationships]
```

**2. Provide Examples in Comments**
```markdown
# constitution.md (Template)

## Article I: [Your Principle Name]
[Describe the principle]

<!-- Example:
## Article I: Library-first development
When solving a common problem, prefer well-maintained libraries over custom code.

Approved libraries:
- HTTP requests: axios
- Testing: jest
- Date handling: date-fns
-->
```

**3. Version Your Templates**
Track template changes so teams can adopt updates:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0 -m "Initial web app template"
git push --tags
```

## Combining framework + Spec Kit

### The hybrid workflow

Use both tools in sequence for maximum learning and efficiency:

#### Phase 1: Learning (Use This Framework)
**Tools:** Template 1 + Template 2  
**Duration:** 2-4 projects  
**Goal:** Build intuition for what makes good specifications

```
1. Pick a small project (e.g., todo app, RSS reader)
2. Use Template 1 to build conversationally with an AI
3. Use Template 2 to extract specifications from the conversation
4. Validate specs with 2-3 AI models
5. Measure adherence (aim for 85%+)
6. Reflect: What made the spec effective or ineffective?
```

**You'll learn:**
- How much detail specs need
- Which principles actually matter
- How different AI models interpret instructions
- What causes specification failures

#### Phase 2: Transition (Hybrid Approach)
**Tools:** This Framework + Spec Kit  
**Duration:** 2-3 projects  
**Goal:** Apply learnings to Spec Kit workflows

```
1. Use Template 2 to draft initial specifications
2. Validate with multi-model testing (framework approach)
3. Import refined specs into Spec Kit
4. Use Spec Kit's slash commands for development
5. Continue multi-model validation on final code
```

**You'll learn:**
- How to translate framework specs to Spec Kit format
- Which Spec Kit features provide most value
- How to customize constitutions effectively

#### Phase 3: Production (Use Spec Kit)
**Tools:** Spec Kit CLI + Templates  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
**Goal:** Efficient, standardized specification-driven development

```
1. specify init --template [your-org-template]
2. Customize constitution based on project needs
3. Write specifications (now you know what works!)
4. Use specify chat for AI-powered development
5. Periodically validate with multiple models (framework approach)
```

**You'll benefit from:**
- Fast project initialization
- Standardized team workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Version-controlled specifications

### When to return to the framework

Even after adopting Spec Kit, use this framework for:

- **Experimentation:** Testing new constitutional principles before standardizing
- **Quality Audits:** Multi-model validation of critical specifications
- **Training:** Teaching new team members specification principles
- **Post-Mortems:** Analyzing why a project didn't meet expectations

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

### 1. **Over-Specification in Constitution**

‚ùå **Problem:**
```markdown
## Article I: Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons at end of statements
- Use camelCase for variables
[...50 more style rules]
```

‚úÖ **Solution:**
```markdown
## Article I: Code Style
Follow the project's .eslintrc and .prettierconfig for style.

Key principle: Consistency over personal preference.
```

**Why:** Constitutions should focus on *architectural* principles, not linting rules. Let automated tools handle style.

### 2. **Vague Specifications**

‚ùå **Problem:**
```markdown
## Feature: User Management
The app should have user accounts and authentication.
```

‚úÖ **Solution:**
```markdown
## Feature: User Management

**Authentication:**
- Users register with email + password
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (min 12 rounds)
- JWT tokens for session management (24hr expiry)
- Forgot password flow via email

**Authorization:**
- Role-based: admin, editor, viewer
- Admins can CRUD all resources
- Editors can CRUD own resources
- Viewers read-only access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New user can register in <2 seconds
- Login failure shows generic error (security)
- Password reset email arrives in <5 minutes
```

### 3. **Not Using Slash Commands**

‚ùå **Problem:** Long AI conversation drifts from original specifications.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Use `/constitution` every 5-10 messages to re-ground the AI.

### 4. **Forgetting to Update Specs**

‚ùå **Problem:** Your code evolves but specifications stay frozen.

‚úÖ **Solution:** 
```bash
# After completing a feature
specify chat "/update specification.md - Document feature X as implemented"
git add .specify/
git commit -m "docs: Update specs for feature X"
```

### 5. **Skipping the Plan**

‚ùå **Problem:** Jumping straight from specification to code.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Always populate `plan.md` with phases, milestones, and acceptance criteria. It's your roadmap.

---

## Success metrics

### How to measure Spec Kit effectiveness

Track these metrics to know if you're using Spec Kit well:

#### 1. **Specification Stability**
```
Spec Changes Per Week = (# of specification.md commits) / (weeks since project start)

Target: <2 changes per week after initial setup
```

**What it means:** Frequent spec changes suggest you're discovering requirements late. Good specs stabilize after initial drafting.

#### 2. **AI Adherence Rate**
```
Adherence Rate = (Features implemented correctly) / (Total features) √ó 100%

Target: 85%+ across multiple AI models
```

**How to measure:** Use this framework's multi-model validation on Spec Kit projects!

#### 3. **Task Completion Velocity**
```
Velocity = (Tasks completed this week) / (Tasks completed last week)

Target: Consistent velocity (1.0) or improving (>1.0)
```

**What it means:** If velocity drops, your tasks might be too large or specs too vague.

#### 4. **Constitutional Violations**
```
Violations = (# of code reviews requesting changes for principle violations)

Target: <1 violation per 10 pull requests
```

**How to track:** Tag PR comments that cite constitutional violations.

#### 5. **Time to First Working Feature**
```
Time to First Feature = (Hours from 'specify init' to first deployable feature)

Target: <8 hours for simple projects, <40 hours for complex
```

**Benchmark:** Compare against your Template 1 projects. Spec Kit should be faster after the learning curve.
